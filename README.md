# Amazing-Real-Estate-Web-App

I built Realance, start to finish. Realance will be the online office of Realance Homes and Property, a real estate firm. Visitors and buyers can view hundreds of property listings with scrollable property images, videos, perimeter sizes and features before they ever need to schedule a live tour. All property features such as (bath, rooms, location, price, size and more) are displayed for each of the properties.
Visitors will be able to see details and furnished status of the properties. Buyers will be make to schedule a direct call or reach out to us through the contact us section.

The Definition of project completion is that project wass released to production at least at the end a Sprint. It includes rules such as:

Web-pages don’t have dead links or buttons that don’t work;
Web-pages don’t have temporary texts or images;
Web-pages work in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari and on a selection of mobile devices;
Every item is verified against relevant and common OWASP attacks. 
The code for an item is peer-reviewed by someone else in the team. Someone else in the team verified that the item worked as specified;

Initially, the app was to be built with Angular and material UI but Nextjs was preferred for its SEO functionality. High level overview; The frontend is being developed with Nextjs, Reactjs and Chakra UI for amazing styling and fast development. 
Each of the frontend was being sectioned into components (courtesy of React) and components were put together to form pages. With the beautify layout provided by Nextjs, I developed and integrated every elements (website logo, banner, slides, footers with quick links, property page, property listings and featured products.) in a short time.
